This is a project developed in PyQt that allows you to create mazes, save and play them!

The core idea of the project was to help people build grid based games without the need to code.

This project uses the idea of using csv(comma separated value) files to store and retrieve data based on the way the user builds the grid.

The idea of the project can be scaled to build:
  1. game building apps that do not require code
  2. drag and drop mechanisms for faster development
  3. custom level generators for 2d games to speed up the development process
